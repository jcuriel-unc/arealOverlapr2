#' Summarise the dyadic population overlap between 2 levels of geography
#' 
#' This function takes the raw output of the weight_overlap function (also part of the arealOverlapr pkg), and calculates the 
#' population overlap between two levels of geography, and the demographic information of interest from census data. 
#' @param weight_output The outputted data frame from the weight_overlap function
#' @param shp_atom The atomic unit of geography shpfile that will be used to calculate the spatial weights by population
#' @param id1 The ID field (chr) from the first shpfile of interest. 
#' @param id2 The ID field (chr) from the second shpfile of interest.
#' @param census_fields The string vector of other population fields of interest referring to census data that should be caclulated, 
#' which amounts to the raw weighted number of the individuals part of the demographic in question residing within the overlap of the 
#' two shpfile polygons of interest 

#' @return The data frame with the dyadic population overlap between the first and second shapefiles. The following are the values:
#'    \itemize{
#'    \item id1 = The renamed id field from the first shpfile 
#'    \item id2 = The renamed id field from the second shpfile 
#'    \item pop_wt = The summed weighted population estimated to reside between the two shpfiles of interest 
#'    \item census_fields_wt = The vector of census fields with "_wt" pasted to reflect the population estimated from the chosen 
#'    census fields. 
#'    \item shp1pop = The total estimated population residing within the first level of geography
#'    \item overlap1 = The degree of nestedness of the first level of geography within the second level, 0 - 1.
