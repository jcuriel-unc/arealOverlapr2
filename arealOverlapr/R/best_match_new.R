#' Find the crosswalk between the shp1 and shp2 polygons based on highest overlap. 
#' 
#' This function takes the raw output of the overlap_dyad_creatr function (also part of the arealOverlapr pkg), and calculates slices the 
#' data to single unique values for the shp1 file. Observations are cut to the unique shp1 values for where the overlap between the 
#' two is maximized for a given grouping of dyadic data. 
#' 
#' @param overlap_dyad_output The outputted data frame from the overlap_dyad_creatr function
#' @param id1 The ID field (chr) from the first shpfile of interest. 
#' @param id2 The ID field (chr) from the second shpfile of interest.
#' @param census_fields The string vector of other population fields of interest referring to census data that should be caclulated, 
#' which amounts to the raw weighted number of the individuals part of the demographic in question residing within the overlap of the 
#' two shpfile polygons of interest 

#' @return The data frame with the dyadic population overlap between the first and second shapefiles. The following are the values:
#'    \itemize{
#'    \item id1 = The renamed id field from the first shpfile 
#'    \item id2 = The renamed id field from the second shpfile 
#'    \item correctly_matched_pop = The numeric field of the estimated number of people residing between within the overlying area
#'    between the shp1 polygon and the shp2 polygon with the highest degree of overlap.
