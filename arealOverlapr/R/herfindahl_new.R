#' Calculate the herfindahl index of the first level of geography
#' 
#' This function takes the raw output of the weight_overlap function (also part of the arealOverlapr pkg), and calculates the 
#' population overlap between two levels of geography, and the demographic information of interest from census data. 
#' @param overlap_dyad_output The outputted data frame from the overlap_dyad_creatr function
#' @param shp_atom The atomic unit of geography shpfile that will be used to calculate the spatial weights by population
#' @param id1 The ID field (chr) from the first shpfile of interest. 
#' @param id2 The ID field (chr) from the second shpfile of interest.
#' @param census_fields The string vector of other population fields of interest referring to census data that should be caclulated, 
#' which amounts to the raw weighted number of the individuals part of the demographic in question residing within the overlap of the 
#' two shpfile polygons of interest 

#' @return The data frame with the dyadic population overlap between the first and second shapefiles. The following are the values:
#'    \itemize{
#'    \item id1 = The renamed id field from the first shpfile 
#'    \item herf_index = The Herfindahl index, a measure of the diversity of shp2 units within the shp1 file. The scale ranges from 0
#'    for complete heterogeneity and division across shp2 polygons, and 1 for complete homogeneity and nestedness within a single 
#'    shp2 polygon.  
#'    \item eff_num = The effective number of shp2 polygonal units within the shp1 polygons. This is the inverse of the Herfindahl
#'    index.
